# Scrap Survivors
Ok that was stressful but we got grass
can refactor it and make it better

building

enemies but they are jank
spawning is jank too, is it just gonna be minecraft spawning?

player attacking: point in cone, fuck it ill just have a circle collider lol, approximately a cone
or we could have arc of circle and basically constrain it like that
yea plus i can draw it

pickups


if mouse held less than a frame input doesnt occur?

glitched indestructable enemy lol.



Ok make suck actually attract pickups rather than be extended pickup range
definitely wanna pong enemies back

how to apply a velocity gracefully with position based dynamics - after the fixup step i guess?
or have a separate velocity field for knockback / sliding - like i do with player

cull / spawn defs not working.
this is a shitshow but it will get there have faith


ccd enemies do come from somewhere

at night the ghosts of the dead ones come back
